#Letra de Himnario Adventista en Espa√±ol#
*(Adventist Hymnal Lyrics in Spanish Only)*

This Hymnal is property of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church. I do NOT claim to have made or own any rights to the lyrics or songs. If there is any need for takedown please reach out to me. The only purpose for this repository is to facilitate the worshipping of God with the many songs we know and love. I once myself, found the need to have the lyrics ready for display in Propresenter and other presenting software. I wished there was an easy way to just download and play instead of typing. However, I could not find anything. I then took the time to obtain this digital version which is easy to download and import. I hope that if you are in need, this can be a blessing for you and your church. Please note that the lyrics are in Spanish only. God bless you.
